The merge conflict in part E1 was resolved by making a decision on how to handle the merge.
I accepted both branches and then went to the merge manager to detail how git will combine them.
Afterwards I had to commit my changes to be able to push.
I also got an error prior to the merge, but that was just because of unsaved changes and easily resolved.

The changes made in part c1 are as follows:
services.html line 1: /*comment*/
team.html line 1: /*comment*/
vision.html line 1: /*comment*/
