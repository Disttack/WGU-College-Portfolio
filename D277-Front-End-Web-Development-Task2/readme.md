Introduction
To be successful as a front-end web designer or developer, you must be able to structure content in HTML and present a visual representation of the structure for various devices using CSS and JavaScript. In this task, you will further design, develop, and implement the low-level comprehensive page layout you created in the previous task. Your work for Task 2 will not be evaluated until Task 1 has been submitted and passed.

In this task, you will have the opportunity to demonstrate your HTML and CSS skills as well as your ability to implement user-centered solutions by creating a website about one of the states within the United States. As you create your website, you will use an external style sheet for the design and layout of the site. Each page should have the same layout to maintain a consistent user experience throughout the site. You will publish your website to one of the free hosting sites listed in the Web Links section.

Note: Because your site will be live, use caution with the content and images you include on your website. The public will have access to your website, so do not include any sensitive or private information.

Note: All the code in your submission must be original work. You may not use premade templates of any sort, including the templates provided in the exercise files of the course, blog software such as Blogger and WordPress, content management systems like Joomla! and PHP-Nuke, GUI web design software like Adobe Dreamweaver, or any type of “WYSIWYG” application that produces the code by clicking a button.
Scenario
Congratulations, you got the job! You just finished your first week at the state government office where you completed the orientation and onboarding documentation. You have also met with your new supervisor daily to learn more about the department and expectations of your role, as well as your new colleagues who have been teaching you about the systems used in the office. You are now ready to develop the new website for the state government office.
Requirements
Your submission must be your original work. No more than a combined total of 30% of a submission and no more than a 10% match to any one individual source can be directly quoted or closely paraphrased from sources, even if cited correctly. An originality report is provided when you submit your task that can be used as a guide.



You must use the rubric to direct the creation of your submission because it provides detailed criteria that will be used to evaluate your work. Each requirement below may be evaluated by more than one rubric aspect. The rubric aspect titles may contain hyperlinks to relevant portions of the course.



Tasks may not be submitted as cloud links, such as links to Google Docs, Google Slides, OneDrive, etc., unless specified in the task requirements. All other submissions must be file types that are uploaded and submitted as attachments (e.g., .docx, .pdf, .ppt).
